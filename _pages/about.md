I am a Senior Manager of R&D at [SenseTime](), working closly with [Chen Qian]() from 2018. Before that, I was an Algorithm Engineer at Y-tech (formerly Y-lab), Kuaishou Technology, from May 2018 to Feb. 2023. I was an Algorithm Intern at Didi Research Institute, Didi Chuxing, from Oct. 2017 to May 2018.

I obtained the PhD degree from University of Technology Sydney (UTS) supervised by Prof. Dacheng Tao and the joint PhD degree from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) co-supervised by Prof. Jane You, both in 2018.

I received the BEng degree in Electronics and Information Engineering, and MEng degree in Signals and Information Processing, both from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

My primary research involves deep learning, machine learning and probabilistic graphical models, with particular interests in deep generative models, representation learning and structured prediction. With these tools, my research also covers applications in computer vision, image processing and data mining.

** Job positions are open for researchers and interns at SenseTime! **

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
